# BlueprintBoard
A C# .NET class library which provides a .NET control for drawing paths in a blueprint styled canvas.  This tool has little use but the code may help people with certain things, so I decide to publish it. Look at the demo and how it interacts with the main control (BlueprintBoard), to figure out how it works. It is quite self-explanatory.
Features:
-	Draw freeform path.
-	Draw straight lines.
-	Erase points or paths.
-	Move points or path (with shift in the demo).
-	Snap path points to grid intersections or other points in other paths.
-	Load and save the blueprint as XML.
